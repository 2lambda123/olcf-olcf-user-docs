Mount OLCF Filesystems
######################

OLCF shared filesystems can be mounted into a container running in Slate. The mountpoints
will be the same as a cluster node. The Kubernetes object will need to be annotated in order
to get the necessary configuration injected into the container at runtime.

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Cluster", "Annotation", "Value", "Mounts"
  :widths: 5, 8, 5, 25

  "Marble", "ccs.ornl.gov/fs", "olcf", "/ccs/sw, /ccs/home, /ccs/proj, /gpfs/alpine"
  "Onyx", "ccs.ornl.gov/fs", "ccsopen", "/ccsopen/sw, /ccsopen/home, /ccsopen/proj, /gpfs/wolf"

If you already have a Deployment running you can add the annotation with the client

.. code:: bash

  oc annotate deployment web ccs.ornl.gov/fs=olcf

.. warning::
  You cannot annotate an existing pod because the injection happens at pod creation time

  .. pull-quote::

    Annotating a pod not managed by a deployment with ``oc annotate pod test ccs.ornl.gov/fs=olcf``
    will not work. Instead delete the pod and add the annotation to the metadata and recreate it.

You can also add the annotations to any workload object's YAML such as a Pod, Deployment,
or DeploymentConfig.

.. code:: yaml

  metadata:
    annotations:
      ccs.ornl.gov/fs: olcf

Full example of a deployment mounting the OLCF shared filesystems:

.. code:: yaml

  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: test-fs
    annotations:
      ccs.ornl.gov/fs: olcf
  spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: test-fs
    template:
        labels:
          app: test-fs
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: test-fs
          image: busybox:latest
          args:
          - cat
          stdin: true
          stdinOnce: true

.. note::
  There are no requirements in the container image in order to mount OLCF filesystems
