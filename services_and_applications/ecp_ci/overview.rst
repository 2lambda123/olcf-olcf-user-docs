ECP CI Overview
***************

The ECP Continuous Integration (CI) resources are based on `Gitlab's CI componenets <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/>`_, but enhanced for HPC centers. These `enahancements <https://ecp-ci.gitlab.io/docs/introduction.html#enhancements>`_ were identified as critical, to improve the ability of application and software technology projects to test across diverse HPC architectures and software environments.

You can find the central ECP CI Documentation, for all participating HPC Centers, at the main `ECP CI documentation page <https://ecp-ci.gitlab.io/index.html>`_. 

The documentation you are looking at now is specific to OLCF's site-local model, to enable initial testing of ECP CI integration at OLCF. An overview of the different ECP CI models can be found `here <https://ecp-ci.gitlab.io/docs/introduction.html#ci-use-models>`_. The `Federeated Model <https://ecp-ci.gitlab.io/docs/introduction.html#federated-model>`_ being the model that integrates all participating HPC facilities.

**The Federated Model is NOT enabled yet. Currently, the site-local model is the only accessible implementation at OLCF.**
