OLCF Office Hours
---------------------

    * Login to your Moderate account at `myOLCF <https://my.olcf.ornl.gov/login>`_
    * Expand the OFFICE HOURS dropdown (on the sidebar navigation)
    * There are 2 options to select: **Schedule a Time** and **View Your Scheduled Office Hour(s)**

     **Schedule a Time** - Fill out the required fields in the form. On the date selection, use the arrows to scroll between
     months and then click on a specific day. Once a day is selected, choose an available time slot by clicking the
     `Reserve a Spot` button. Once all the required fields are filled in and a time slot is selected you can submit the form.

     **View Your Scheduled Office Hour(s)** - This will show you your office hours for the current project you have selected.
     If you have an office hour scheduled and don't see it there, make sure you have the correct project selected from the
     `MY PROJECTS` dropdown on the top of the page.
