Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs)
**************************

.. _dtn-system-overview:

System Overview
===============

The Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) are hosts specifically designed to provide optimized data transfer between OLCF systems and systems outside of the OLCF network. These nodes perform well on local-area transfers as well as the wide-area data transfers for which they are tuned. The OLCF recommends that users use these nodes to improve transfer speed and reduce load on computational systemsâ€™ login and service nodes. OLCF provides two sets of DTNs: one for systems in our moderate enclave and a second for systems in the open enclave.

.. _dtn-access-connecting:

Interactive Access
==================

DTN access is automatically granted to all enabled OLCF users. For interactive access to DTNs (``ssh``/``scp``/``sftp``), connect to ``dtn.ccs.ornl.gov`` (for the moderate enclave) or ``opendtn.ccs.ornl.gov`` (for the open enclave). For example:

::

    ssh username@dtn.ccs.ornl.gov

For more information on connecting to OLCF resources, see :ref:`connecting-to-olcf`.

Access From Globus Online
=========================

DTNs are also accessible via the "OLCF DTN" (for moderate) and "NCCS Open DTN" (for open) Globus endpoints. For more information on using Globus at OLCF see :ref:`data-transferring-data-globus`.


Batch Queue (Slurm)
===================

The moderate DTNs also support batch jobs. The system contains 8 nodes accessible through the DTN batch system.

Most OLCF resources now use the Slurm batch scheduler, including the DTNs.
Below is a table of useful commands for Slurm.

+--------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| Task                                       | Slurm             |
+============================================+===================+
| View batch queue                           | ``squeue``        |
+--------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| Submit batch script                        | ``sbatch``        |
+--------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| Submit interactive batch job               | ``salloc``        |
