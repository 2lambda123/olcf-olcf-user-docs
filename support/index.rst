OLCF User Assistance Center
----------------------------

    The `OLCF User Assistance Center <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/for-users/user-assistance/>`_ remains open and available for support.  
    Users should follow normal support procedures when reporting issues or requesting help.

    * `Submit a Support Ticket <https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/for-users/getting-started/submit-ticket/>`_
    * Email us at help@olcf.ornl.gov
    * Sign-up to attend `OLCF Office Hours`_


When submitting a ticket to help@olcf.ornl.gov requesting help, you will likely
get faster resolution by supporting a few best practices:

- Where possible, provide helpful details that can help speed the process. For
  example: Project ID, relevant directories, job scripts, jobIDs, modules at
  compile/runtime, host name, etc.
- When replying to a ticket, do not modify the subject line.
- Do not piggyback unrelated questions on existing tickets. This leads to slower
  response times and inflates ticket history.
- Do not open multiple tickets on the same unresolved topic. Doing so can
  fragment resources and slow down the time to resolution.
- Please do not respond to previous tickets with new, unrelated issues. This can
  slow down response time and make finding relevant information harder thereby
  slowing down time to resolution.
- Let us know if you've solved the issue yourself (and let us know what worked!)
- MOST IMPORTANT: do not hesitate to contact us (help@olcf.ornl.gov); we will
  work through the details with you.

OLCF Office Hours
---------------------

Would your project team like direct access to OLCF, AMD, and HPE staff for current issues or questions you might have about
running your application/software on Frontier? If so, we are offering office hours every Monday from 2-3 PM EDT and Wednesday
from 1-2 PM EDT. During each session, (up to) 5 teams will move into their own Zoom breakout room to discuss their question/issue
directly with the appropriate OLCF, AMD, and HPE staff. Topics can be anything from issues building your code, non-ideal
performance, node failures, etc.

To help ensure proper expertise available to discuss your issue, please follow the below steps to let us know about your
issue and request an available time slot.

If you encounter issues during sign-up, please contact help@olcf.ornl.gov.

    * Login to your Moderate account at `myOLCF <https://my.olcf.ornl.gov/login>`_
    * Expand the OFFICE HOURS dropdown (on the sidebar navigation)
    * There are 2 options to select: **Schedule a Time** and **View Your Scheduled Office Hour(s)**

     **Schedule a Time** - Fill out the required fields in the form. On the date selection, use the arrows to scroll between
